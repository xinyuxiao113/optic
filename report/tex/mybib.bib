ABSTRACT = {In the present paper we summarize the methods and results of calculations for the theoretical informational quantities obtained in our works for the nondispersive optical fiber channel. We considered two models: the per-sample model and the model where the input signal depends on time. For these models we found the approach for the calculation of the mutual information exactly in the nonlinearity parameter but for the large signal-to-noise power ratio. Using this approach for the per-sample model we found the lower bound of the channel capacity in the intermediate power range.},
