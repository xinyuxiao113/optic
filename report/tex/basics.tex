\subsection{Polarization model dispersion}
Basic relationships in vacuum:
\begin{equation}
\lambda f = c, \omega = 2\pi f, k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} = \frac{\omega}{c}
\end{equation}
\begin{table}[htbp]

    \begin{tabular}{lll}
    physic        & variable  & unit \\
    \hline
    wave length   & $\lambda$ &  [m]  \\
    \hline
    frequency    &  f         & Hz \\ 
    \hline
    angular frequency & $\omega$ & [rads/s] \\
    \hline
    wave number    &   k        &  [rads/m] \\

    \end{tabular}

    \label{physical variable}
\end{table}
When a beam of light goes into fiber, its frequency remains the same, wavelength changes, then its velocity 
changes.
$$
v(\omega) = \frac{c}{n(\omega)}
$$
\begin{equation}
\lambda f = v(\omega), \omega = 2\pi f, \beta = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} = \frac{\omega}{v(\omega)} = \frac{n(\omega)\omega}{c}
\end{equation}

In real fibers, small departures from cylindrical symmetry, 
occurring because of random variations in the core shape along the fiber length, 
result in a mixing of the two polarization states by breaking the mode degeneracy.
Mathematically, the mode-propagation constant $\beta$ becomes slightly different for the modes polarized in the x and
y directions.  This property is referred to as modal birefringence.  The strength of modal
birefringence is defined by a dimensionless parameter.
$$
B_{m}=\frac{\left|\beta_{x}-\beta_{\gamma}\right|}{k_{0}}=\left|n_{x}-n_{\gamma}\right|
$$
beat length:
$$
L_{B}=\frac{2 \pi}{\left|\beta_{x}-\beta_{y}\right|}=\frac{\lambda}{B_{m}}
$$


\subsection{Coherent detection}
We use a electronic field to describe light:
$$
\mathbf{E}(z, t)=\mathbf{E}_{0} e^{i(k z-2 \pi f t)}=\left(\hat{x} E_{0 x}+\hat{y} E_{0 u}\right) e^{i(k z-2 \pi f t)}
$$
We use a Jones vector to describe a polarization state of light.

We consider Homodyne Receiver
$$
E_s(t) = A_s(t) exp(j\omega_s t)
$$

\subsection{Adaptive filter theory}



Some DSP techniques need to learn:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Coherent receiver
    \item FDBP (filter DBP)
    \item FOE (Frequency offset estimater)
    \item BPM (Batch power normalization)
    \item MIMO (Multi Input Multi Output)
    \item CPE (carrier phase estimator)
\end{itemize}

Problems to derive:
\begin{itemize}
    \item NLSE -- CNLSE
\end{itemize}
